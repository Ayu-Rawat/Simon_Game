# Simon Game

## Project Overview
This is a simple implementation of the classic Simon game. The game challenges players to remember an increasingly long sequence of lights and sounds, and repeat them back in the correct order. The objective is to see how long the player can maintain the sequence without making a mistake.

## How to Play
1. The game will flash a sequence of lights and play corresponding sounds.
2. Your task is to memorize the sequence and repeat it by clicking on the buttons in the correct order.
3. After each successful round, the sequence gets longer, increasing the difficulty.
4. If you click the wrong button, the game ends and you have to start over.

## Features
- Dynamic difficulty: the sequence grows with each correct level.
- Visual and auditory feedback for each sequence.
- Responsive design: playable on both desktop and mobile.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
