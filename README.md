The Simon Game is a classic memory skill game where players are challenged to remember and replicate increasingly complex sequences of colors and sounds. Each round, the game presents a pattern of lights, and the player must repeat the exact sequence by pressing the corresponding buttons. As the game progresses, the patterns become longer and more difficult, testing the player's concentration and memory. It's a fun and engaging way to sharpen cognitive skills while providing an entertaining challenge.
